- Enable Firebase services in production
- Deploy security rules before going live

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Service account format invalid"**
   - Email must end with `.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Use Firebase service account, not personal email

2. **"Private key invalid"**
   - Must start with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`
   - Should be ~2000+ characters long
   - Copy from downloaded JSON file exactly

3. **"Firebase connection failed"**
   - Check all environment variables are set
   - Restart development server after changing .env
   - Run `npm run firebase:test` to diagnose

4. **"Admin emails still using example.com"**
   - Replace `admin@example.com` with your real email
   - Multiple emails separated by commas

**Get Help:**
```bash
# Test current configuration
